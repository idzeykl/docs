# Introduction to IdzeyKL

IdzeyKL is an interpreted programming language with dynamic typing. It supports basic programming constructs including variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and arrays. The language is designed for simplicity and flexibility.

## Key Features

- Dynamic typing
- Simple and intuitive syntax
- Support for basic data types (numbers, strings, booleans, arrays)
- First-class functions
- Built-in array operations
- Automatic type conversion

## Getting Started

To start using IdzeyKL, you'll need to:

1. Install the IdzeyKL interpreter
2. Create a new file with `.ikl` extension
3. Write your first program

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```ikl
println("Hello, World!");
```

## Language Design Philosophy

IdzeyKL is designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Simplicity**: The syntax is straightforward and easy to learn
2. **Flexibility**: Dynamic typing allows for rapid development
3. **Expressiveness**: The language provides powerful features while maintaining readability
4. **Consistency**: Similar operations follow consistent patterns
